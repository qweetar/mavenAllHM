One day my son Davey-steamboat showed up in my office with my rated 'R' Java tutorial in his hands. 
He asked me to teach him programming so he could create computer games. 
At that time I've already written a couple of books on Java and taught multiple classes about computer programming, but all of this was for grownups!
A search on Amazon could not offer anything but books for dummies, but Davey is not a dummy! 
After spending hours on Google I found either some poor attempts to create Java courses for kids, or some readerrabbit-style books. 
Guess what? I decided to write one. 
To help me understand the mentality of the little people, I decided to ask Davey to become my first kid student.
